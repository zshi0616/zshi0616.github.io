Zhengyuan Shi (Áü≥Ê≠£Ê∫ê, Stone) is a Ph.D. Candidate in Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by [Prof. Qiang Xu](https://cure-lab.github.io/). 
Prior to my journey in CUHK, I obtained the B.Eng. degree with presidential scholarship in Shandong University in 2021 and was supervised by [Prof. Gangqiang Yang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/g37yang/en/index.htm). 
I gained valuable experience as an intern at Huawei, Hisilicon and Xilinx, and also worked as a visiting student at CityU and UBC. 

**I'm looking for job opportunities, will graduate in Dec. 2025.**


My research focuses on the following areas: 
- **AI for EDA**: Large Circuit Model, Logic Synthesis and Formal Verification. 
- **AI for Optimization Problem**: SAT/SMT, MaxSAT, ILP. 

I have published more than 20 papers at the top EDA conferences and journals, including DAC, ICCAD, DATE and ASPDAC. I also served as reviewer for DAC, ICCAD, TVLSI, Sci China Inf Sci and etc.
